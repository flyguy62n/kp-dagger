## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-6)
Focus on core infrastructure and architecture. No user-facing features but solid foundation for everything else.

### Phase 2: Parsing (Weeks 7-16)
Implement all device parsers. Users can parse configs but limited analysis available.

### Phase 3: Analysis (Weeks 17-24)
Add security analysis capabilities. Core value proposition becomes available.

### Phase 4: Polish (Weeks 25-30)
Complete CLI, reporting, and user experience. Production-ready release.

### Phase 5: Release (Weeks 31-34)
Final testing, documentation, and release preparation.
